praise my Svior, without Him I would not be alive He saved me more times than i can imagine, He is working in the background at all times protecting me more than i could possibly imagine. Surround me alt all times Lord. Sharpen my mind God. Help me to never get stuck up but to give you everythign i have Lord.
